[The Christmas Release](https://dgolddragon28.github.io/Unangband/2018/07/03/Version070pre1.html)
==============================

*[Version 0.7.0-pre1 is live!](https://github.com/DGoldDragon28/Unangband/releases/tag/v.0.7.0-pre1)*

After so long, quests finally do something. Not all quest flags are yet implemented, and those which are
are not fully tested; but some have been tested and they work! Quest descriptions are still bugged, which
is the main reason for calling this release 'pre1'. Big thanks to @dennis-roof for several UI upgrades and
bugfixes in this release also.

I hope to release a more stable version soon, but there are a lot of things on my plate, so I cannot give
an exact timetable.
